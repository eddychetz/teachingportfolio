## About Me

I am a Statistician, and a Data Science lecturer operating within the Data Science Cluster at Belgium Campus ITversity even though Data Science learning stretches from business understanding to value addition to data-driven firms that make use of data science to optimise its operations.

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from Midlands State University (ZW) and Masters of Science in Operations Research and Statistics from National University of Science and Technology (ZW). I am currently in the enrolling process for a Masters in Data Science with University of Cape Town (UCT). Prior to joining education in 2018, I was made responsible of taking up classes in the following modules; Applied Mathematics (MAT151, MAT1781, MAT281), Applied Statistics (STA1781, STA2781), Linear Programming (LPR1781, LPR2781, LPR381) and Machine Learning (MLG381, MLG382). Amongst these modules, I also include Data Science related modules such as Research Methods (RSH381), Academic Writing (ACW1781), and End User Computing (EUC151) which I believe to help the students to become researchers rather than focusing only on the majors.

Regardless of the differences in these modules, this portfolio reflects my personal journey, over the last 3 years. A journey that has taken me from being Mathematician who teaches, focused on preparing students for their professional careers, to being a researcher who shares his passion. I now understand more clearly, that how I teach, is just as, if not more important than what I teach, and that through my teaching, I can contribute to making students responsible and active members of society.
