## Introduction
As a Data Science lecturer, my vision is centered on bringing up the best candidate for a Business Intelligence (BI) expert;

## At Course Level

- To build studentsâ€™ trust in their mathematical abilities when addressing real-life problems through data-driven approaches.
- To inspire free-thinking and collaborative mindset among students and teach them to be game-changers in their chosen professions. (Group tasks to encourage teamwork).
- To inspire the minds of a generation through logical thinking.

## At Study Program Level

- To prepare students to be change makers in their professional workforces after graduation (highlighting the integration of courses as they move towards being industry-ready candidates, e.g.: for being a ML Engineer these are connected together for a best candidate: SQL, Algebra, Statistics, Optimization, and Programming, etc.).
- To promote the virtues of scientific method, research and scholarly inquiry so students can bring important critical thinking skills to their pursuits outside of college.

## For Connection Education - Research - Services to the Community

- To help students identify and solve the major challenges facing civilization in the coming decades through use of data-driven approaches.
- To cultivate partnerships between my students and industry so that they leave university with both workforce ready skills and the social capital required for gaining meaningful employment in their fields.
