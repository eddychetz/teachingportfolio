## Strategies

My approach to teaching and learning is very unique and vary from one module to another. Applied Mathematics is a theoretical subject, students are required to understand the fundamental concepts of the subject and reflect its outcomes to some real-world application. In order to achieve this, outcomes are explained, demonstrated on a whiteboard to allow everyone to visualize and understand the concept. Students are given breathing space to digest concepts before assigning them tasks during the lecture session. Students are not given solutions to these activities to allow them to be fully engaged in the course study. My classes encourage active participation of students in order to fully understand the subject.

When conducting the lecture in an online environment, students are required to give feedback privately when they are given tasks to do. This helps with control of the lesson to avoid disruptions in thinking to students that are slow a bit. Once the majority of the students provide feedback, one of the students is voluntarily selected to share the feedback with the entire class. This enables students to understand better when explained by their peers. This teaching approach is mostly employed in both online and face-to-face environments when teaching theoretical subjects such as Applied Mathematics 281 and Machine Learning 381.
